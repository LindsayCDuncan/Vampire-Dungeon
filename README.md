# Vampire-Dungeon
Dungeon project from University of Helsinki's MOOC: https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-10/

Description: The player (as denoted by '@' char) moves around a grid with WASD for a set number of turns. However, the player may move as many times as desired within that turn. Vampires (denoted by the 'v' char) move randomly, but will move the same number of moves as the player. When the player contacts a vampire, it dies and is removed from the board. The player wins when all the vampires are dead. If the player runs out of turns, the player loses.

Note: I intentionally deviated from the exact requirements from the MOOC.
